        <p> My sweetheart, It's incredible to think that more than 10 years has passed since you entered my life and filled it with love and joy. You've been my light, my constant source of happiness, and my greatest blessing.</p>
        <p>From the moment we met, I knew there was something special about you. Your warmth, laughter, and radiant smile captivated me instantly. Over these year, I that how extraordinary you are — kind, compassionate, loyal and so thoughtful. You inspire me every day to be the best version of myself.</p>
        <p>Our time together has been a beautiful journey filled with unforgettable moments. I still remember the excitement of our first date, the way you made me feel so comfortable with your charm, and every silly joke or deep conversation we've shared since. Whether we're out exploring or enjoying quiet evenings, life feels brighter with you by my side.</p>
        <p>I adore the little things that make you unique—the way you light up when you're passionate about something or laugh at even stupid jokes. These moments remind me how lucky I am to love and be loved by you.</p>
        <p>As we celebrate this valentine, I dream of our future—a life full of love, laughter, happiness and adventures. Thank you for being my partner and for making my life complete.</p>
        <p>Here's to our journey ahead. I love you more than words can ever express.</p>
        <p class="closing">I love you alot!</p>
        <p class="signature">Yours forever, <br>Prashant</p>
